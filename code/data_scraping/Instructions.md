Tools: 

* Google Data Studio for visualization (maybe also dashboards),

* Tableau for dashboards

* Flourish for some fancy gifs

* Python for Predictions


Ideas: 

* Visualization before introducing the model:

Use Tableau and Google Data Studio to do some visualization for an explanation. For example, we need to let every audience know our criteria (attributes we use) for rating players. For example, I used DBPM and OBPM (Defensive and offensive box plus/minus) to judge the performance of a player in playoffs and visualize it by Tableau. (See my Tableau demo at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zixuan.xu7872/viz/Book1_17007795066920/Sheet2?publish=yes) My plan is to first do some visualization like this to guide the audience to gradually understand some necessary NBA knowledge and then introduce our model accordingly.
Also, for demo visualization using Google Data Studio, please see the picture below.
